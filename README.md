# PersistentResourceView
Mod for Cities:Skylines

This mod changes the behaviour of the play mode resource info view and all map editor info views so that they only close when you either: 
1. Close it yourself 
2. Select another info view 
3. Open a tool that opens an info view (electricity/water etc.)
